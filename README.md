## Problem Statement:
With Digtilazion, there has seen a massive impact on society that leads to Transformation and Innovation.

The enormous growth in Digital shift can be seen in the finance sector: the mass increment in online transition.
<br>

Well,
It's lovely to enjoy the seamless transition, Superfast services, But when it comes to security and Authenticity. 
The pillars of Information security shake.

I am talking about <strong>Integrity</strong>.

<br>

Because of the Centralization "Power in a single hand", The porthole to fraud cases, cyber attacks Manipulation of data, corruption, and other critical problems is still open.

Hence,
There needed a super savior.

Something,
That prevents miscellaneous attacks.  Preventing the formation of monopolies and allowing equal power distribution.

<br>

Well, 
The prayer was heard by Blockchain, and it came in the rescue mission.
